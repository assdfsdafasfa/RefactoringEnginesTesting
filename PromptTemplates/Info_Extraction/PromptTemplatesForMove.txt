You are an expert in software testing and refactoring. I’ll provide you with a historical bug report of refactoring engines. Please
extract the following information from the report based on the given extraction example:
1. The program to be refactored;
2. The refactoring scheme
3. Bug symptoms;
The given extraction example: 
Bug report:[
1. Create the following classes:
public class O {
	private S _s;
	public void m(){}
}
public class S {
	public void m(){}
}
2.Now use the move refactoring to move method O.m to S.
3.The refactoring performs and produces the compile error without indicating an error status: Duplicate method m() in type S S.java
]
1. The program to be refactored： [
public class O {
	private S _s;
	public void m(){}
}
public class S {
	public void m(){}
}]
2. The refactoring scheme
[{
Type：move method
  Obj：void m()
  Source：O
 Target：S
}]
3. Bug symptoms: naming conflict
