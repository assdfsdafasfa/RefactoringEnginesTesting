You are an expert in software testing and refactoring. I’ll provide you with a historical bug report of refactoring engines. Please
extract the following information from the report based on the given extraction example:
1. The program to be refactored;
2. The refactoring scheme
3. Bug symptoms;
The given extraction example: 
Bug report:[
public class T11337_1 {
void f(byte bytes) {
/∗ [ ∗/ System.out. println (bytes) ; /∗ ] ∗/
 }
 }
]
1. The program to be refactored： [
public class T11337_1 {
void f(byte bytes) {
/∗ [ ∗/ System.out. println (bytes) ; /∗ ] ∗/
 }
 }
}]
2. The refactoring scheme
[{
Type：Extract method;
Ojb:  System.out. println (bytes) ;
EnclosingEntity: T11337_1;
Newname: f
}]
3. Bug symptoms: naming conflict
