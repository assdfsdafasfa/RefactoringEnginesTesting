You are an expert in software testing and refactoring, please modify the following historical refactoring case based on the given example to generate test cases for other refactoring types：
[Example of source code:[Class A{static public void m(int i){} private void k(){}}refactoring type: rename method; refactoring operation: rename "k()" t0 "m()"]
Rename transformation migrated to Inline Refactoring：Class A{static public void m(int i){} private void k(){int a; System.out.println(a)}}
Please perform similar migrations on the follo
wing programs as described above, and fill in the concrete Inline Refactoring code example after migration,change variable:[source code: public class Test{
void m(){
final int i= 0;
class X{
void m(){
// rename j to i;
int j=2;
i= j;
}
}
};
}
][refactoring type: rename variable; refactoring operation: rename "j" to "i"]

[The result of migration to Inline Refactoring：{}]
