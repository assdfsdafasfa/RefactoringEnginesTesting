You are an expert in software testing and refactoring, please modify the following historical refactoring case based on the given example to generate test cases for other refactoring types：
[Example of source code:[class A{	private void foo() {m();} public void m(){}}   
after refactoring:[]
refactoring type: inline method; refactoring operation: inline "m()"
Inline transformation migrated to Rename Refactoring：class A{	private void foo() {m();} public void m(){}}
Inline transformation migrated to Move Refactoring：class A{	private void foo() {B.m();} } class B{A a; public void m(){}}
Please perform similar migrations on the follo
wing programs as described above, and fill in the concrete Inline Refactoring code example after migration,change variable:[source code:    
 public void testIt() {
  	// blah
  	String test = "";
  	System.out.println(test);
  }

][refactoring type: inline variable; refactoring operation: inline "" to ""]
Please only generate the migration results code below:
[The result of migration to Rename Refactoring：{}]
