You are an expert in software testing and refactoring, please modify the following historical refactoring case based on the given example to generate test cases for other refactoring types：
[Example of source code:[Class A{static public void m(){} private void k(){}} class B{} class C{} refactoring type: rename method; refactoring operation: rename "k()" t0 "m()"]
Rename transformation migrated to Move Refactoring：Class A{static public void m(){} private void k(){}} class B{ }class C{private void m(A a){}}
Please perform similar migrations on the follo
wing programs as described above, and fill in the concrete Move Refactoring code example after migration,change class: [source code: class Foo {
    class Baz {}
    void test(Baz bar) {
        
    }
    void test1() {
        Baz bar = new Baz();
    }
    void test2() {
        List<Baz> bars = new ArrayList<>();
        bars.forEach(bar -> System.out.println(bar));
    }
}
][refactoring type: rename class; refactoring operation: rename "Bar " to "Baz"]
[The result of migration to Move Refactoring：{}]
