public class A {
    protected final int a = 1;
}
public class B {
    void main() {
        final int b = 2;
        new A() {
            void m() {
                System.out.println(b);
            }
        };
    }
}

If in class "A" I do rename field "a" to "b", it silently does it, and in class "B" "println" statement becomes to print value of field (not local var).
