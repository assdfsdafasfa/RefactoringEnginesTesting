You are an expert in software testing and refactoring, please modify the following historical refactoring case based on the given example to generate test cases for other refactoring types：
[Example of source code:[class A{	private void foo() {m();} public void m(){}}   
after refactoring:[]
refactoring type: inline method; refactoring operation: inline "m()"
Inline transformation migrated to Rename Refactoring：class A{	private void foo() {m();} public void m(){}}
Inline transformation migrated to Move Refactoring：class A{	private void foo() {B.m();} } class B{A a; public void m(){}}
Please perform similar migrations on the follo
wing programs as described above, and fill in the concrete Inline Refactoring code example after migration,change method:[source code:   public void myTest(List list, String s1, String s2) {
}

public void myTest(Collection list, String s1, String s2) {
}

public void usage() {
List list = new ArrayList();
String aa = "AA";
String bb = "bb";
myTest(list, aa, bb);
Collection col = new ArrayList();
myTest(col, aa, bb);
}
][refactoring type: inline method; refactoring operation: inline "" to ""]
Please generate the migration results code below:
[The result of migration to Rename Refactoring：{}]
[The result of migration to Move Refactoring：{}]
